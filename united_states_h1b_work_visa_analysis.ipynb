    "The aim of this exploratory analysis is to find interesting patterns in the H-1B Labor Condition Application (LCA) process, specifically to learn about which applications get certified or denied and what employers can do to increase their chances of obtaining H-1B work visas for their international employees.   \n",
    "\n",
    "A **case status** is the status of the H-1B application after LCA processing. LCA either certifies or denies the application. Once applications are certified, they are sent to USCIS for H-1B approval. For Further information on the H-1B application process, see this [article](https://redbus2us.com/what-is-h1b-lca-why-file-it-salary-processing-times-dol/).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inspiration:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What are the top 10 occupations for H-1B visas with certified status?\n",
    "2. Which company hires the most data scientists based on H-1B applications?\n",
    "3. What is the average salary for data scientists based on H-1B applications? How does it compare to the average salary of all H-1B applicants? \n",
    "4. Which state has the highest proportion of denied to total H-1B applications? And by state popuplation?\n",
    "5. What industries are in the top 5 percentile of H-1B applications?\n",
    "6. What month is the tipping point for a high rate of denied applications? \n",
    "\n",
    "**Insights from the analysis:**\n",
    "- Applications software developers, computer systems analysts, computer programmers, and other computer occupations topped the list of occupations that received H-1B certified status. Others occupations include management analysts, accountants and auditors, network administators, and financial analysts.\n",
    "- Microsoft hires the most data scientists (40), outpacing Facebook's distant second of 12 hires, and Uber's distant third of 6 hires.\n",
    "- H-1B certified Data Scientists earn an average of \\$88,646 which is 17% more than the average of all H-1B visa applicants, \\$75,735.\n",
    "- The state of Hawaii has the highest rate of H-1B visas denied (13%). This makes sense since Hawaii is mainly a tourist economy and most certified H-1B applications are from the high-tech/computer and Finance industries. \n",
    "- The state of Delaware has the highest rate of H-1B denied by population. Delaware's economy is primarily agriculture, manufacturing, and mining.\n",
    "- 52 industries are in the top 5 percentile of applications. Holding top rank is Computer Programming Services.\n",
    "- H-1B visa applications are more likely to obtain certified status when applied early in the year. A significant number of applications are denied starting from October. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Key take-aways gained from this analysis are:**\n",
    "1. The competition for H-1B visas is very high as there are more applicants (93,533) than visas (80,000). The timeliness of the application submission is critical. To increase their chances of success, employers should submit their H-1B applications before October.\n",
    "2. Good news for H-1B data scientists! They earn 17% more than the average H-1B applicants.\n",
    "3. If you're a data scientist and a non-citizen of the US, apply first to Microsoft, Facebook and Uber."

    "With a thriving economy in the US, many companies are petitioning H-1B working visas for their foreign national workers. This exploratory analysis uncovered insightful facts and trends about the H-1B visa applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The majority of the H-1B certified applications went to applicants working in the the High-Tech/Computer industry.\n",
    "- By far, Microsoft hires the most data scientists (40) whic is 3X more hires than Facebook (runner-up).\n",
    "- Data scientists earn an average of \\$88,646 which is 17% more than the average of all applicants.\n",
    "- The state of Hawaii has highest rate of denied H-1B applications (13 percent) while the state of Delaware has the highest rate of H-1B denied by population. \n",
    "- 52 industries are in the top 5 percentile of applications. Holding top rank is Computer Programming Services with 31,941 H-1B visa applications. \n",
    "- The month of H1-B application submission plays a role on how likely the application will be denied. Applications are more likey to get certified when submitted early in the year. They are likely to be denied starting from October.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight gained from this analysis is the timeliness of application submission. This piece of information is very useful to employers. To increase their chances of success, employers should submit their H-1B visa applications as early as possible in the year. A denied application means that the foreign national workers cannot start working for the company. This would have a huge impact on the business bottomline."
